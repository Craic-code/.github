# Craic Code

## Who we are
Well this is easy...it's just [Me](https://github.com/paddyduff31)! This is my personal org for keeping everything in one place...it makes it easier to find on GitHub desktop and teaches me some more of the things a GitHub org can do!

## What we do
I'm mostly using this for apps at the minute and want to build out the list!  Currently I have [Chardee Macdennis](https://chardeemacdennis.mmm.page/) in production 3 others underway.

### Released to the app stores
Chardee Macdennis - Inspired by my favourite show if your a Sunny fan you'll know!  If not, it's a crazy drinking game!

### Under development
Disney Jammers - Inspired by my daughter I am making a "Finish the Lyrics" quiz app based on disney songs.  
Bar Buddy - Inspired by my previous career, a bunch of hospitality calculators.  
Ninja dude - Inspired by my childhood, I used to look out the window of the car and imagine a little ninja running along building tops(this was before mobiles haha).  

## Why we do it
Being quite experienced in React and having a good grasp of React native I wanted to explore the full end to end, Fastlane, getting to the App store, seeing my App analytics and enjoying the process. I also want to make 200 million :moneybag:
